## 📖 The Problem: "Screen Fatigue" in Travel

Modern tourism has a paradox: We travel to see the world, but we spend most of our time staring at screens reading Wikipedia articles or following maps.

**MonuTell** solves this by providing an "eyes-up" experience. It uses **Geolocation** to detect landmarks in Budapest and narrates their stories via high-quality AI-generated audio, allowing users to immerse themselves in the environment while walking.

### 📱 The User Experience (Mobile PWA)

The app is designed with a "Mobile First" approach, featuring a clean interactive map and an audio player that syncs with the user's walk.

_Features: Real-time GPS tracking, Interactive Leaflet Map, Azure Neural TTS Audio._

### 🛠️ The "Kitchen": Admin & Automation

Behind the scenes, the system is powered by a custom Admin Dashboard and an AI Content Pipeline.

| **Management:** Secure dashboard to approve or reject user-submitted places. | **Pipeline:** Custom Node.js CLI script that generates content using Gemini & Azure. |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This project operates on a "Headless" content generation model. The content is pre-generated via a custom **Node.js Automation Engine** ([`scripts/architect-engine.js`](./scripts/architect-engine.js)) and served via a serverless React app.
